Note from Ellen below: "Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the Earth Engine App on Heroku. "
Does not work although I followed the instructions :). https://docs.google.com/document/d/197jvxxajqEfCHbuw_2EcxHAv83Pjka36/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101065852418423274055&rtpof=true&sd=true
Author will have to test. I can test it if desired. Others are also welcome to test this.
Was tested and closed by author in beginning of March. Feel bad that is happening right now.
