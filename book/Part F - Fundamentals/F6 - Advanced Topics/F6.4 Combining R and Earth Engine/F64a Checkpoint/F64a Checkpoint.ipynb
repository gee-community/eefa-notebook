Nevertheless, some difficulties can appear when users try to connect both languages. If you are a new Python user, we recommend using the built-in ee_install function. In Rstudio, press Ctrl + Enter (or just Enter on macOS) to execute the code line by line.\n",

In short, it performs the following tasks': (1) Creating a Python environment, (2) creating an environment variable, EARTHENGINE_PYTHON, that stores your Python interpreter path (which will help rgee know where to look the next time you log in), and (3) installing the dependencies in the previously created environment. Alternatively, users who want to use their own Python environment could run, instead of ee_install, one of the following options, depending on their operating system.\n",
